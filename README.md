### Abstract:
Anthropogenic activities pose a significant risk to vulnerable marine ecosystems like coral reefs, particularly those near human population centers. Despite coral reefs being one of the systems most at risk, the relationship between contaminant exposure and coral health across gradients of ecosystem disturbance remains poorly understood. Our metabolomic analysis of 380 corals from 16 sites spanning an anthropogenic impact gradient revealed that the coral metabolome is predictive of anthropogenic ecosystem disturbance. We found that human activities both within catchments and in the marine ecosystem altered the chemodiversity of coral metabolomes with a direct relationship to historic trends in coral cover: nitrogen reserves and metabolome energetic potential were reduced, while stress metabolites were enriched at more impacted sites. We further identified 25 anthropogenic contaminants from agricultural, cosmetological, industrial, and pharmaceutical sources accumulated in coral metabolomes. Our results suggest that the bioaccumulation of pollutants in corals impacts all but the most remote reef ecosystems, which will disproportionately threaten communities reliant on reefs. Together, our findings demonstrate a direct relationship between coral health, accumulation of dangerous contaminants within corals, and anthropogenic disturbance that is consistent across species.

## Repository Overview:
In this repository you will find the code used to analyze this data and all raw data <br /> <br />
We have tried to clearly index each script and file below but if you have any questions please email me: zquinlan@gmail.com <br /> <br />

All raw data is in the subdirectory data/raw/

*****
# Contents:
## code - all the code that we used to analyzed the data in the above manuscript
#### featureAnalysis.R
  - Note this code is used to analyze both Monitpora and Porites tissues, separately. Within the code itself are noted the two points where the species must be defined in order to analyze them respecitvely. 

<br /><br />
## data - raw data, plots, and analyzed spreadsheets we exported during analysis
* not all of this was used in the publication <br />
### analysis:
- In here there are many exports from statistical analyses and some curated datasets although the majority that are used, remain in the scripts themselves.<br />

### plots:
- Plots and figures generated in R<br />
